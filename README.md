# Mental-Fitness-Tracker
Welcome to the Mental Fitness Tracker! This project was created during an internship at IBM as a tool to help individuals track and improve their mental well-being. In today's fast-paced world, taking care of our mental health is crucial, and this tracker aims to provide a convenient way to monitor your emotions, moods, and overall mental fitness.

The dataset used in this Mental fitness Tracker is taken from https://skillsbuild.edunetworld.com/courses/ai/mental-fitness-tracker provided by IBM.
