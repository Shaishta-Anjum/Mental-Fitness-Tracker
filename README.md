# Mental-Fitness-Tracker
Welcome to the Mental Fitness Tracker! This project was created during an internship at IBM as a tool that utilizes advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence to analyze and predict the mental fitness level of individuals from diverse countries, each grappling with different mental disorders. This Mental Fitness Tracker uses only one model, which is the Random Forest Regression.

The dataset used in this Mental fitness Tracker is taken from https://skillsbuild.edunetworld.com/courses/ai/mental-fitness-tracker provided by IBM.
